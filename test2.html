        <p>On a date and time, you were assigned to fulfill Station Guard Duty at the Hamond Barracks Guardroom. At that particular moment, two individuals entered the reception area and provided their biographical information. One of the men reported an incident in which, while he was walking along a road, two other men approached him and demanded, "Give me everything in your pocket now." The assailants proceeded to search him and confiscated several items, including a Glock pistol with 35 rounds of 9mm ammunition, an iPhone 10, and a car key. Subsequently, one of the suspects inquired about the location of his car, to which he gestured towards a black vehicle situated across the road. Both men promptly fled the scene in the aforementioned vehicle. A male bystander who observed the incident from across the road kindly offered assistance to the victim, escorting him to the police station. Upon receiving the report, you immediately dispatched a radio message to alert the necessary personnel. Approximately twenty minutes later, W/Constables Green and Whyte arrived at the guardroom accompanied by an individual whom the victim positively identified as one of the assailants. Following this development, you proceeded to inquire with W/Constable Green about the whereabouts of the second suspect. She disclosed that during their encounter, the second suspect had initiated gunfire, posing a significant threat to their lives. In self-defense, they responded with fire. Unfortunately, this exchange resulted in the second suspect sustaining critical injuries, necessitating urgent transportation to KPH (Kingston Public Hospital), where Dr. McKenzie subsequently pronounced him deceased. Regrettably, the stolen vehicle remains unrecovered.</p>
