        <p>A lady attended the station and reported that between the hours of 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm, she was walking down a road when she heard footsteps behind her. When she turned around, she saw two men. One of the men pointed a gun at her and demanded her phone. The woman handed over her phone, but as she did, her car keys fell to the ground.

            The second man, who was without a gun, picked up the keys and asked her where her car was located. She pointed to a vehicle across the road. The man without the gun then made an inappropriate comment about her appearance in the nighttime. He proceeded to grab her and forcibly pushed her into a corner, where he engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with her.
            
            During this disturbing incident, the other man kept a lookout. Eventually, both suspects fled the scene using the woman's car.<p>
