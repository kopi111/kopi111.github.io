									<p  style="color:black;line-height: 2.2;"> Miss Chi reported that one night she was at home when 
										she woke up to find Kwame, a man she knew, and five other gang members in her house armed with guns. 
										Kwame pointed the gun at Miss Chin and stated, 'Mi come fi everything you have.' While doing so, 
										the magazine dropped out of the gun and hit the floor, causing two 9mm rounds to fall out of the magazine. Kwame then picked up the magazine and rounds.
										
										
										Kwame then asked Miss Chi for sex, but she refused. Brook, Miss Chi's son, walked into the room, and Kwame used a knife to wound him on his hand. 
										Kwame then threatened Miss Chi, saying that if she did not have sex with him, something bad would happen. Miss Chi eventually agreed to have sex with Kwame.
										 He inserted his left index finger into her vigina and had sex with her. Kwame and his gang then took her Samsung phone and threw it on the ground, causing damage to the screen, 
										 in hopes that she would not call the police. They also took her car keys and stole the following items from her house, which they placed in her car before driving off: <br> 
										 • 
										 One gold ring <br> • One laptop  <br>• One desktop computer Later  <br>The men returned with a truck and stole the following items from Miss Chi's house:  <br>• One bed head with mattress  <br>• 
										 One Samsung fridge and the stated “tell the police and u see if me kill you”<br> 
										 Prior to the incident, Miss Chin was paying Kwame $20,000 a month because he demanded it. <br> 
										Two days after Kwame drove a truck to the Negril police station, he walked to the lockup area where Constable Brown, who is attached to the Negril police station, was working. Kwame told Constable Brown that he wanted to drop off two loaves of bread for his friend. While searching the bread, Constable Brown found a phone hidden inside it. Kwame immediately ran off and jumped into his truck, driving away.
										
										Constable Clarke, who was in the station yard talking to Detective Corporal Jackson, both ran to the exit gate and aimed their service pistol at the truck. Kwame then jumped out of the truck, pleading with them not to shoot him. The truck was searched, and the following items were found: <br> 
										• 2 million Jamaican dollars <br> • 6 million US dollars <br> • 20 boxes of bleaching cream • 70 pounds of ganja • 20 pounds of cocaine <br> • 100 pounds of yellow yam <br> • 600 boxes of cooking oil <br> • 50 boxes of cornflakes
										<br>Kwame claimed that the cornflakes were given to him by a friend named Joe, who he later found out had stolen them.</p>
